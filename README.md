## General Info

**Spooky Bats** is a mod being made for Mycelium Network's 2023 Spooky Jam. It adds a ton of unique bat variations to the game!
All bats can naturally be found throughout the overworld.

## More Details
In addition to spookily flying around, each bat drops a specific type of candy when it's killed. Each of these candies can be consumed, but beware because not all of them are beneficial!

The mod also adds a special bat type called the Void Bat. This bat does not naturally spawn in game. But, if you click it, you'll be sent to the end, as if you made contact with an ender portal.

## What's Planned?
Pretty much everything in this mod is susceptible to change as of now, mainly the models and the AI of the bats. The primary focus for the future updates of Spooky Bats is to add uniqueness and identity to each bat, both in their physical models and their AI.

We also plan on adding some cool new bat variants, possibly some fitting various dimensions or "themes" of the game.

**Note:** This mod works on both Forge and Fabric!
